    <h2>Background Story</h2>
    <p>
        Extractosaurus is a T-Rex dentist known for his... unique approach to tooth extraction. 
        With his powerful jaws and questionable techniques, teeth tend to "just come off" during his procedures. 
        Whether this is due to his natural T-Rex strength or his dental expertise remains a topic of debate 
        among his colleagues.
